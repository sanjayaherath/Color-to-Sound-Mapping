# Color-to-Sound-Mapping

## Introduction ##

This is the project developed for second year project for the courses EE251-Principles of Electrical Measurements and EE254-Electronic Instrumentation. A device was developed to map colors to sound for visually impaired people.

**Group Members:** [Sanjaya Herath](https://sanjayaherath.github.io/), Madri Madawala, and Ishara Madushan.

**Supervised by:** [Dr. Janaka Wijayakulasooriya](http://eng.pdn.ac.lk/deee/staff/academic/dr.j.wijayakulasooriya/profile.php)

## Project Overview ##

Measurements obtained from an LDR was analyzed for different colours. The firmware was developed using Arduino and signals were analyzed using MATLAB. Red, Green and Blue LEDs were illuminated on a surface sequentially and the LDR measurement was acquired. The three dimensional dataset was project to a 1D vector using FDA. Then each differentiated class was mapped to a specific music note.
